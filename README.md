        How can project managers ensure deadlines are met. By clearproject planning and scope definition, effective resource allocation, risk management and planning.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Answer:
    Effective cost control ensures that a software project remains financially viable, meets its objectives within budget, and delivers expected value.

    To maintain control over software development costs, the following strategies should be employed:
    1. Accurate budget planning.
    2. Scope management.
    3. Agile development and iterative budgeting.
    4. Regular cost monitoring and reporting.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Answer:
    Comparison of agile and waterfall methodologies are as follow, 
    1. Agile are iterative and incremental. while, waterfall are sequential and linear.
    2. Agile are highly adaptable to changes. While, waterfall are rigid, changes are difficult after initial planning.
    3. Agile are continuous, that is it evolves throughout development. while, waterfall are fixed at the beginning.

    Advantages and disadvantages of agile and waterfall:
    1. Highly adaptable to changes in requirements.
    2. Continuous feedback improves product quality.
    3. Faster time-to-market with incremental releases.

    1. Clear structure with well-defined phases
    2. Easier to manage and plan with a fixed timeline and budget
    3. Detailed documentation helps with long-term maintenance

    Disadvantages:
    1. Requires experienced teams and strong collaboration
    2. Harder to predict costs and timelines accurately

    1. Rigid and inflexible to changes once development starts
    2. Late testing phase increases the risk of discovering critical issues too late

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Answer:
    Agile is best suited for projects that:
    1. Have evolving or unclear requirements

    1. Software Startups & SaaS Development
    2. Mobile app development
    3. E-commercewebsite enhancements

    Waterfall is best suited for projects that:
    1. Have fixed, well-defined requirements
    2. Require strict documentation and approvals
    3. Have low tolerance for mid-project changes

    Examples of Waterfall-Suited Projects
    1. Government & Military Software Development
    2. Medical device software
    3. Banking and financial systems

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Answer:
     Maintaining software quality requires a structured approach throughout development.
     1. Implement a strong testing strategy
     2. Use automated testing
     3. Continuous integration and continuous deployment

     Importance:
     1. Prevents costly fixes later
     2. Enhances user satisfaction
     3. Increases software reliability

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Answer:
    It establishes the boundaries, objectives, deliverables, and constraints of a project. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks or deliverables.

    Key Features of a WBS:
    1. Breaks down the project into phases, deliverables, and tasks.
    2. Uses a tree-like structure or numbering system for easy tracking.
    3. Defines scope boundaries clearly to avoid unnecessary work.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Answer:
    1. Improved time management
    2. Better resource allocation
    3. Clear task dependencies
    4. Enhanced risk mitigation
    5. Improved communication

    A Gantt chart is a visual project management tool that displays tasks, timelines, and dependencies in a bar chart format.
